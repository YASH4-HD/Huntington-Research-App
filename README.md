# Huntington-Research-App
Computational analysis framework for Huntington’s Disease (OMIM: 143100).  
This project integrates KEGG pathway data (hsa05016) and gene interaction networks into an interactive Streamlit dashboard to explore metabolic dysfunction, proteotoxicity, and neurodegenerative mechanisms in Huntington’s Disease.

## 🧠 Project Motivation

Huntington’s Disease is a monogenic neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the HTT gene, yet its downstream metabolic and cellular consequences remain incompletely understood.  

This project was developed as an **independent computational research initiative** to:
- Systematically explore genes involved in the KEGG Huntington’s Disease pathway (hsa05016)
- Visualize interaction networks centered on HTT
- Provide biological interpretation of pathway components relevant to mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, and proteostasis
## 🚀 Features

- Automated retrieval of Huntington’s Disease pathway genes from **KEGG (hsa05016)**
- Interactive gene table with search and biological role annotations
- Protein interaction network visualization centered on **HTT**
- Functional role classification (core HD genes vs pathway components)
- Integrated literature references for biological interpretation
- Streamlit-based interactive dashboard for exploration
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
